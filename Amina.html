            <p>Amina of Zaria, also called the ‘Warrior Queen’, was Queen of Zazzau (now known as Zaria) which was located in what is now Nigeria. She is famous for being the first queen in a society dominated by males, and made her name known to history for expanding the Hausa people’s territory.  She was the 24th habe (the title given to Zazzau rulers) and was the eldest of 3 siblings. However after the death of their father in 1566, the rule was passed onto her younger brother, Karama, as he was a male. In his tenth year of ruling he died, and the throne was passed to Amina. Whilst her father (Bakwa) and brother had been ruling, Amina had been honing her battle skills and by the time she became queen she was a fearsome warrior who was greatly respected by the Military.</p>

            <p>During her 34 year reign, she embarked on and commanded numerous military campaigns and aggressions intended to ensure safe passage for Hausa traders throughout the land, yet was incredibly potent in expanding the borders of the Hausa territory further than anyone before of even after her. Amina dominated a vast area of land, along with the trade routes associated with it, connecting the western Sudan with Egypt in the east and Mali in the north. As was custom in her time, she collected tributes of kola nuts and male slaves from her conquered cities. As per tradition of her people, Amina also built walls around the camps of the territories that she took over, with some of the walls surviving even today as a legacy of her rule.</p>
